This tutorial will go through the steps of setting up your application/settings on Spotify.
You will also need to install Node.js.

You will also need npm and express. Install in the terminal via:

When the installation is completed, check that your project folder now contains a subfolder called node_modules, and that that folder contains at least those packages.

You may also need the following:  
npm install --save express  
npm install --save request  
npm install --save cors  
npm install --save cookie-parser  

In order to run the webpage, open the Terminal.
Navigate to your folder with the *app.html* file (e.g. cd cd /spotify/get-user-info)
Run the following in the Terminal to start up the Node.js server:
node server.js
